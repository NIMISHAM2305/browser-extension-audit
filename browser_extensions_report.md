##  Removed Extensions:
1. **Tabby Cat**
   - **Reason:** Entertainment-only purpose, not essential. Slightly impacts performance with animations. Unclear publisher trust. Removed for better focus and security.

##  What I Learned:
- Browser extensions can:
  - Access and modify site data
  - Slow down browser performance
  - Pose a privacy risk if permissions are abused
- Always check the source, purpose, and permissions.
- Regularly auditing extensions reduces security risks.

## ðŸ“ˆ Post-Removal Observation:
- Cleaner, faster browser startup.
- Reduced distractions on new tab pages.
